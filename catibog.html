                <h1>My Journey as a BSIT Student</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi! I’m a BS Information Technology student at Cavite State University (CvSU), and this blog is where I share my journey into the world of web development.
                    It all started with a simple curiosity: <strong>How are websites made?</strong> That question led me down a path of endless discovery. As I explored the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized how powerful these tools are in building the digital world around us.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, I’m trying to build multiple projects—ranging from static pages to interactive, mobile-responsive websites. I’m learning to design clean layouts, code user-friendly interfaces, and debug problems (a lot of them!). Every challenge taught me something new—not just about tech, but about patience, creativity, and persistence.
                    <br><br>
                    Along the way, I’ve also started exploring tools and frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and version control with Git. I love seeing how small lines of code can bring big ideas to life.
                    <br><br>
                    This blog is a reflection of my growth—not just in skills, but in mindset. Whether you're a fellow student, aspiring developer, or just someone curious about tech, I hope my posts inspire or help you in some way.
                    I'm still learning, still experimenting, and still building—and I'm excited for what’s ahead. Thanks for being part of the journey!
