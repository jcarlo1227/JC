      <p class="content">Hi! Iâ€™m a BS Information Technology student at Cavite State University (CvSU), and this blog is where I share my journey into the world of web development.
                    It all started with a simple curiosity: <strong>How are websites made?</strong> That question led me down a path of endless discovery. As I explored the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized how powerful these tools are in building the digital world around us.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, Iâ€™m trying to build multiple projectsâ€”ranging from static pages to interactive, mobile-responsive websites. Iâ€™m learning to design clean layouts, code user-friendly interfaces, and debug problems (a lot of them!). Every challenge taught me something newâ€”not just about tech, but about patience, creativity, and persistence.
                    <br><br>
                    Along the way, Iâ€™ve also started exploring tools and frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and version control with Git. I love seeing how small lines of code can bring big ideas to life.
                    <br><br>
                    This blog is a reflection of my growthâ€”not just in skills, but in mindset. Whether you're a fellow student, aspiring developer, or just someone curious about tech, I hope my posts inspire or help you in some way.
                    I'm still learning, still experimenting, and still buildingâ€”and I'm excited for whatâ€™s ahead. Thanks for being part of the journey!</p>

      <h3 onclick="togglePost(this)">ðŸ“Œ Why I Love Front-End Development</h3>
      <p class="content">1. Instant Creativity Meets Functionality <br>
Web development is one of the few fields where you can see your ideas come to life immediately. From a blank screen, I can design, build, and deploy something others can interact with. Whether it's a portfolio, a blog, or a useful tool, thereâ€™s satisfaction in turning imagination into something tangible.
<br><br>
2. Continuous Learning and Innovation <br>
The web evolves constantly. With new frameworks, tools, and design trends always emerging (like React, Tailwind, or Web3 integrations), thereâ€™s always something new to learn. This keeps me motivated and engagedâ€”web development is never boring, and it encourages me to grow every day.
<br><br>
3. Global Reach and Real Impact <br>
Websites are accessible anywhere in the world. Whether it's a student using a library system I built, or a local business using a site I designed to attract customersâ€”what I create can genuinely help others, no matter where they are.
<br><br>
4. The Blend of Logic and Design <br>
Web development balances technical logic with artistic creativity. Writing clean code is just as important as making it visually appealing and user-friendly. That mix of structure and creativity is incredibly fulfillingâ€”it exercises both sides of the brain.
<br><br>
5. Personal Growth and Freedom <br>
Itâ€™s a career that supports freedom and flexibility. I can build my own projects, contribute to open-source, freelance, or even work remotely. The skills Iâ€™m learning today give me control over my futureâ€”both creatively and professionally.
